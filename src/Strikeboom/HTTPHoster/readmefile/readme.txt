You ever wanted to host files on the internet on your IP
This tool allows you to do that with any type of files and host html websites

Instructions:
-Put your port in port.txt (has to be a number between 0 and 65535) (Make sure to forward the port)
-Put all your files in to the resources folder (can be folders it will just host all the files in all the folders)
-Make sure to keep running because all the hosts will close until ran again

Note: If firewall asks for security clearance its because hosting a server of any kind needs windows firewall access

How to use your files:
on your web browser go to [your ip]:[port in port.txt]/path/to/your/file
or go to just to [your ip]:[port in port.txt] and navigate through landing page

for example if I had an ip of 25.011.052.410 with a port of 51551 and a file path of /images/vacation/beach.png in the resources folder
25.011.052.410:51551/images/vacation/beach.png
